# Racetrack_NEAT

This is an implementation of the NEAT algorithm on a race track. The algortihm was used to teach agents(cars) how to drive and as a result reach the finish line.

To see how the game works run game.py. Can take a long time depending on the CPU to find the winning strategy, so prepare some snacks.
